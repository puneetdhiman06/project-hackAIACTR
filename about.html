                    So it all started when we were both worrying that in our society, there were so many cases coming daily.there were so many people working outside by risking thier own life like the pizza delivery boy or zomato guy etc. They don't have any idea about the building or the area where they were serving or going,also some people visit their relatives or friends in the same building without being aware that a corona positive person was found there. So, those people are at a great risk without knowing about such information. So we are trying to help such people by giving them accurate information about the infected people. <br>
                    By using this web application you can know the exact location of that person or group of people who were found to be corona positive, so that you can take precautions before it is too late.
